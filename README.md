# Diabetes Prediction System

This is a machine learning project that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on various health-related features. The system uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to make predictions. The dataset contains information like the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, age, and more. 

The project includes functions to load, explore, preprocess data, train a machine learning model, evaluate it, and save the model for future predictions.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Exploration**: Loads and explores the diabetes dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scales the features to prepare data for the model.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Prediction**: Makes predictions on new data inputs (e.g., health-related data of a patient).
- **Model Saving**: Saves the trained model and scaler for later use.
